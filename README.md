# Link Preview Smart Chips for Google Docs

This is the code base for a google ad on (see here: https://www.matthewjurow.com/software-projects/link-preview-smart-chips) that enables the new smart chip functionality for GitHub and StackExchange links pasted into google documents.

If enabled the program will display a bunch of information about a GitHub or StackExchange link when you mouse over and will allow you to send the ReadMe to a LLM AI model to summarize with the click of a button.  

Do be patient, I chose a strong model to summarize the text (facebook-bart-large) so summarizing can sometimes take ten or twenty seconds.
